      <h1>About me</h1><hr>
      <p class="lead">Hi! I'm Justin, and I am a 4th year student at UC Berkeley majoring in Electrical Engineering and Computer Sciences. Here are some interesting facts
        about me:</p>
      <h3>Growing up</h3>
      I was born in San Francisco, California in a hospital where a guy named Bruce Lee was also born. Unfortunately, I have a bit of catching up to do
      when it comes to similar physical appearance. Outside of going to college, I have lived in Union City, California my entire life. Recently, my hometown has
      been notable for its indoor skydiving facility.
      <h3>Soccer</h3>
      <p class="lead">I am an absolutely huge soccer fan, and a supporter of <a href="http://www.liverpoolfc.com/">Liverpool FC</a> through and through. However, I can't say that
      I'm any good at actually playing the sport (on a field or on an Xbox 360...). I really enjoy watching teams and all the different tactics they employ. Here are some of
      my favorite sites to read about soccer tactics:</p>
          <ul>
            <li class="lead"><a href="http://zonalmarking.net">Zonal Marking</a></li>
            <li class="lead"><a href="http://www.theguardian.com/profile/jonathanwilson">Jonathan Wilson's Blog</a></li>
            <li class="lead"><a href="http://ohyoubeauty.blogspot.com/">Oh You Beauty - Liverpool Specific Tactical Analysis</a></li>
          </ul>
      <h3>School</h3>
      <p class="lead">I've taken a lot of awesome classes during my time here at Berkeley and am very involved with <a href="http://bc.berkeley.edu">Berkeley Consulting</a> and <a href="http://calblueprint.org">Blueprint</a> on
      campus. Read more about my school experience <a href="../school">here</a>.</p>
      <h3>Projects</h3>
      <p class="lead">I enjoy hacking around on small projects during my free time. Check out some of them <a href="../projects">here</a>.</p>
